I am a PhD student in the Machine Learning department at Carnegie Mellon University, where I work with Ameet Talwalkar. My current research focuses on automating machine learning model selection; the goal is to develop tools and algorithms that will make the practice of machine learning easier and more accessible.

#### Research Interests
* automated machine learning
* hyperparameter optimization
* active learning
* bandits
* gaussian processes
