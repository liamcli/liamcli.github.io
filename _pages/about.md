I recently completed my PhD in Machine Learning from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by [Ameet Talwalkar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~atalwalk/). [My thesis](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/research/phd-dissertation-pdfs/thesis_li_liam.pdf) was on efficient methods for automating machine learning model to make the practice of machine learning easier and more accessible.

Since then, I've joined [Determined AI](https://determined.ai) as a machine learning engineer to build the leading platform for deep learning, enabling users to be vastly more productive and happier!
Post PhD, I continue to be involved in the AutoML community and am working with folks to organize the [2nd ICLR workshop on Neural Architecture Search](https://sites.google.com/view/nas2021).  I also like to stay on top of  exciting discoveries in machine learning and diving into areas of ML that I didn't get to learn more about during my PhD.
