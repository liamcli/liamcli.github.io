After working in consulting and finance for a few years after college, I decided to come back to school and pursue a PhD!  It's been a great ride so far and I hope to learn even more in the coming years!

Some interesting facts about me:
* I've moved 11 times in my life.
* I play the [er-hu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu).
* I played basketball in the NCAA (albeit Division III).

Outside of school I enjoy hiking, snowboarding, and playing go (but I'm no match for AlphaGo).
